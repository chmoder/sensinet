This is some source code for a project I was working on that involved in.
It involved connecting two arduino devices with an Xbee.  One device counts
and transmits how much water has passed to the irrigation device.  The other
receives the data via Xbee and pushes it to USB.  The source code I have
released connects to a mysql database in C and adds records from the Xbee
device real time.  This may be incomplete for your purposes but is a good
start and may offer hints if your looking for help.
